## String Template Library

Create complex formatted strings based on a template string which is comprised of literal strings and substitution definitions.

The two primary object types are `Template` and `Provider`.  

### Template

A template is the blueprint for how to build the final string.  It contains both literal
strings as well as substutition definitions.

### Provider

A provider is the data used while processing the substitution definitions
in the template.   

### My First Template

    Template tmpl("I walked to {{LOCATION}} to meet my friend {{NAME}}");
    
    auto provider = make_provider(
        std::pair("LOCATION", "park"),
        std::pair("NAME", "Dan")
    );
    
    auto final_string = tmpl.fill(provider);
    

### Template String Syntax

Anything not a substitution definition is passed through to the final string literally.
Substitutions are defined as everything between balanced pairs of {{ and }}'s.  

#### Substitution Definition

A substitution is everything between balanced pairs of {{ and }}'s.   

The format of a substitution is:

* Opening delimiter: {{
* Optional leading flags
* Substitution name 
* Optional join string 
* `|` Pipe
* Optional middle flags
* Context-sensitive data
* Closing delimiter: }}



### Leading Flags

Available leading flags (each is optional, but if present must be in this
order):

* optional `<` to ignore empty substitutions
* optional `!` to insert a named template here


### Middle Flags

Available middle flags (each is optional, but if present must be in this order):

* optional `!` following data is an inline template
* optional second `!` the inline template begins on the next line


## Providers

Substitution data can be just about anything.

* No requirements for Copyable
* Callbacks for creating more expensive data, on demand
* Iterable containers
* User-defined types (with either an associated member or free function to create substitution mappings)

Further Provider specializations may be added to the xl::templates namespace
to extend the general functionality of the implementation, such as for supporting
custom smart-pointer types, for example.

### get_provider

A user-defined type may specify how to produce a Provider object via a member instance function,
a free function, or a static function within an explicitly provided class.

Free/static functions have the signature:

    std::unique_ptr<Provider_Interface> get_provider(T &);
    
Member functions have the signature:

    std::unique_ptr<Provider_Interface> get_provider();
    
Note: ProviderPtr is a typedef for std::unique_ptr<Provider_Interface>

### Multiple values for the same template

A template can be automatically expanded for each element of a container (such as a vector).

A 'join string' will be inserted between each element.   The default string is a newline
but can be specified in the substitution definition:

    {{VECTOR_OF_DATA_NAME% join string |!inline template}}
    
for a vector with 3 elements will generate

`inline template join string inline template join string inline template`
    
    
### Join String
When performing multiple replacements, a `join string` may be specified.  This
string will be placed between each replacement.

To put `, ` between each replacement

    {{container%, |!{{value}}}}
               ^

The join string may be specified to be a leading join string by prefixing a 
second `%` before it.

To put `, ` before the first replacement and between each subsequent replacement:

    {{container%%, |!{{value}}}}
               ^^

### Ignore leading/trailing template if replacement is empty

If the replacement string is empty, the leading, trailing, or both parts of the
same line may be ignored as well.

Assuming name is empty, everything until after the subsitution will be ignored

    this will be ignored {{<name}} this will NOT be ignored
                           ^ 
      
    this will NOT be ignored {{name>}} this will be ignored
                                   ^
                                   
    this will be ignored {{<name>}} this will be ignored
                           ^    ^
   
For a more complicated replacement, the `<` and `>` always go at the very
beginning and end of the substitution:

    {{<name%, |!inline template>}}
      ^                        ^
      
Lines above and below the replacement aren't ignored.  

For multiple substitutions on the same line, a `>` on the preceding substitution
will be prioritized over `<` on a subsequent substitution on the same line.  

   

### Performance

Templates are 'compiled' into chunks for increased speed when used multiple times.  Compilation happens on first use
if not requested earlier.  However, there are numerous opportunities for further optimization.
